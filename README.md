VISUALIZE
=========

AVL trees are self balancing binary trees,
which means at every node, the subtrees differ
by a depth of atmost 1.

Visualize is a project aimed at visualization of 
AVL tree operaions such as 
 * Insert
 * Delete
 * Search

And it also shows the intermediate steps involved in
rebalancing the tree after an insert or delete operation
is done on the tree.
